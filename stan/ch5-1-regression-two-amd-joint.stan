// Chapter 5.1: Regression with two predictors, used to simulate confactual 
// plots. In other regression examples from this chapter, I made the variable
// names generic to illustrate the applicability of the code to ifttin data.
// In this case I have named the variables after the data they represent in the
// marriage dataset, because the inferences being made in this case depend upon
// a causal model that is consistent with that specific data, and may not make 
// sense in other contexts.
